flutter notification using awesome_notifications package
this is the whole project but you can focus on these files:

- android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
- android\app\build.gradle.kts
- lib\services\noti_service.dart
- lib\main.dart
- pubspec.yaml

in other words, copy and paste them and you're good to go.

to the person who begged me to do this: buy me a coke later.
